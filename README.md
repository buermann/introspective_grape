IntrospectiveGrape is a Rails Plugin for DRYing up Grape APIs by laying out simple
RESTful defaults based on the model definitions. If you use a schema validator
like [SchemaPlus](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_plus) it will, by
extension, define your endpoints according to your database schema.

It provides handling for deeply nested relations according to the models'
`accepts_nested_attributes_for` declarations, generating all the necessary
boilerplate for flexible and consistent bulk endpoints on plural associations,
and building nested routes for the same.

It also snake cases everything coming in and camelizes parameters in your swagger docs
by default if you `require 'introspective_grape/camel_snake'` in your API.
This behavior can be disabled.

In addition it provides a `IntrospectiveGrape::Formatter::CamelJson` json formatter to
recursively camelize the keys of all your outputs, so ruby and javascript developers
can speak in their own idioms.

## Documentation

In your Gemfile:

```
gem 'grape-kaminari', :github => 'alexey-klimuk/grape-kaminari' # some middleware has fallen into deep disrepair
gem 'introspective_grape'
```

And bundle install.


## Grape Configuration

### Camelization

IntrospectiveGrape's default behavior is to camelize all outputs and snake case all inputs. To camel case all your json output you'll need to use its formatter in your API:

```
formatter :json, IntrospectiveGrape::Formatter::CamelJson
```

It also defaults to monkey patching Grape::Swagger to camelize the API's parameters in the swagger docs and, vice-versa, snake casing the parameters that are sent to your API.

You can disable this behavior by setting `IntrospectiveGrape.config.camelize_parameters = false`.

To include this behavior in your test coverage you need to either access the API's params hash or you can format the response body to `JSON.parse(response.body).with_snake_keys` in a helper method with the `using CamelSnakeKeys` refinement.

### Reloading an object after an update request

By default the gem reloads the object instance before presenting the updated model, a lazy but
effective workaround to updates that may not propagate in the working instance due to actions
a user may take in hooks, or some updates to has_many :through associations. We want to put up
APIs with haste rather than digging our way out of tricky minutae that can be handled later as
technical debt.

This behavior can be disabled by setting `IntrospectiveGrape.config.skip_object_reload = true`,
when you have time for technical debt you can toggle it and work on fixing broken tests (you
did take the time to write comprehensive test coverage, didn't you?).

## Authentication and authorization

Authentication and authorization are presently enforced on every endpoint. If you have named the authentication helper method in Grape something other than "authenticate!" or "authorize!" you can set it with:

```
IntrospectiveGrape::API.authentication_method = "whatever!"
```

Pundit authorization is invoked against index?, show?, update?, create?, and destroy? methods with the model instance in question (or a new instance in the case of index).

The joke goes that you may find you need to allow an unauthenticated user to attempt a log in, which can be handled with something like:

```
 def authorize!
    unauthorized! unless current_user || login_request?
  end

  def login_request?
    # is it the session login endpoint?
    self.method_name.start_with?('POST') && self.namespace == '/login'
  end
```

## Generate End Points for Models

The simplest app/api/v1/my_model_api.rb with the broadest functionality would look like:

```
class MyModelAPI < IntrospectiveGrape::API
  filter_on :all

  restful MyModel, [:strong, :param, :fields, :and, { nested_model_attributes: [:nested,:fields, :_destroy] }]

  class <NestedModel>Entity < Grape::Entity
    expose :id, :attribute
  end

  class MyModelEntity < Grape::Entity
    expose :id, :attribute1, :attribute2
    expose :nested, using: <NestedModel>Entity>
  end
end
```

This would set up all the basic RESTFUL actions with nested routes for the associated model and its association, providing a good deal of flexibility for API consumers out of the box.

IntrospectiveGrape looks in the MyModelAPI class for grape-entity definitions. If you prefer to define your entities elsewhere you could inherit them here instead.

Note that nested entities must be defined before their parents.

## Customizing End Points

Many simple customizations are available to carve out from the default behaviors:

```
class MyModelAPI < IntrospectiveGrape::API
  skip_presence_validations :attribute_with_generated_default_value

  exclude_actions Model, <:index,:show,:create,:update,:destroy>
  default_includes Model, <associations for eager loading>

  include_actions NestedModel, <:index,:show,:create,:update,:destroy>
  default_includes NestedModel, <associations for eager loading>

  paginate per_page 25, offset: 0, max_per_page: false

  filter_on :param

  restful MyModel, [:strong, :param, :fields, :and, { nested_model_attributes: [:nested,:fields, :_destroy] }] do
    # Add additional end points to the model's namespace
  end

  class <NestedModel>Entity < Grape::Entity
    expose :id, :attribute
  end

  class <MyModel>Entity < Grape::Entity
    expose :id, :attribute
    expose :nested, using: <NestedModel>Entity>
  end
end
```


## Skipping a Presence Validation for a Required Field

If a model has, say, a procedurally generated default for a not-null field
`skip_presence_validations` will make IntrospectiveGrape declare the parameter
optional rather than required.

## Excluding Endpoints

By default any association included in the strong params argument will have all
RESTful (`:index,:show,:create,:update, :destroy`) endpoints defined. These can
be excluded (or conversely included) with the `exclude_actions` or `include_actions`
declarations in the API class. You can also include or exclude :all or :none as shorthand.

## Eager Loading

Declaring `default_includes` on an activerecord class will tell IntrospectiveGrape which associations to eager load when fetching a collection or instance.

## Pagination

The index action by default will not be paginated, simply declared `paginate` before the `restful` declaration will enable [Kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) pagination on the index results using a default 25 results per page with an offset of 0. You can pass Kaminari's options to the paginate declaration, `per_page`, `max_per_page`, etc.

## Validating Virtual Attributes and Overriding Grape Validations

To define a Grape param type for a virtual attribute or override the defaut param
type from database introspection, define a class method in the model with the param
types for the attributes specified in a hash, e.g.:

```
   def self.grape_param_types
    { "<attribute name 1>" => String,
      "<attribute name 2>" => Integer,
      "<attribute name 3>" => Grape::API::Boolean }
   end
```

To add additional validations on API inputs you can define a hash of hashes in the model in a
class method ("grape_validations") that will be applied to that field's param declaration:

```
  def self.grape_validations
    { field1: { values: %w(red blue green) },
      field2: { json_array: true },
      field3: { regexp: /\w+/ }
  end
```

## Validating JSON Parameters

IntrospectiveGrape provides the following custom grape validators for JSON string parameters:

```
json: true       # validates that the JSON string parses
json_array: true # validates that the JSON string parses and returns an Array
json_hash: true  # validates that the JSON string parses and returns a Hash
```


## Filtering and Searching

Simple filters on field values (and start and end values for timestamps) can be added with the `filter_on` declaration. Declaring `filter_on :all` will add filters for every attribute of the model.

```
class MyModelAPI < IntrospectiveGrape::API
  filter_on :my_attribute, :my_other_attribute
end
```

Multiple values can be specified at once for Integer attributes that end in "id" (i.e.
conventional primary and foreign keys) by passing a comma separated list of IDs.

For timestamp attributes it will generate `<name_of_timestamp>_start` and
`<name_of_timestamp>_end` range constraints.

There is also a special "filter" filter that accepts a JSON hash of attributes and values:
this allows more complex filtering if one is familiar with ActiveRecord's query conventions.

### Overriding Filter Queries

If, e.g., a field is some sort of complex composite rather than a simple field value you can override the default behavior (`where(field: params[field])`) by adding a query method on the model class:

```
class MyAPI < IntrospectiveGrape::API
  filter_on :my_composite_field
  restful MyModel, [my_composite_field]
end

class MyModel
  self << class
    def my_composite_field=(parameters)
      # parse the passed parameters in some way and return a query scope
    end
  end
end
```

### Custom Filter Methods

To add a custom filter to the index action you can declare a method to be called
against the model class with `custom_filter`. You can pass documentation and type
constraints (it would default to String) and other Grape parameter options in a hash:

```
class MyAPI < IntrospectiveGrape::API
  custom_filter :my_filter, type: Boolean, description: "Filter on some scope"
end

class MyModel
  self << class
    def my_filter(filter=false)
      filter ? my_scope : where(nil)
    end
  end
end
```

## Documenting Endpoints

If you wish to provide additional documentation for end points you can define
`self.<action>_documentation` class methods in the API class (or extend them from a module).

## Grape Hooks

Grape only applies hooks in the order they were declared, so to hook into the default
RESTful actions defined by IntrospectiveGrape you need to declare any hooks before the
`restful` declaration, rather than inside its block, where the hook will only apply to
your own subsequently declared endpoints.
